### Penrose

Penrose is a framework for making beautiful, interactive equations. For more
information, see [penrose.github.io])(https://penrose.github.io)

### The Penrose Library

The Penrose Library is a static API to serve Penrose Packages, including Github
repositories for style, domain specific language (DSL), and substance files.
Each contribution (a package) is maintained in its separate repository, and
has been tested and validated by the maintainers. The API is static, and so
we support only GET.

## Support

If you have questions or want to make a contribution, please 
[open an issue](https://www.github.com/penrose-lib/penrose-lib.github.io/issues), and
we'd be glad to help.
