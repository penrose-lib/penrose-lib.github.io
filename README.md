# Penrose Package Library

This is a static API to test and serve packages for Penrose, including style (sty), substance (sub),
and domain specific language (dsl). You can interact with the API in several ways:

 - [Interactive](https://penrose-lib.github.io/) via a searchable table to find packages.
 - [RestFUL](https://penrose-lib.github.io/docs/) to parse the JSON endpoints served here.
 - [Penrose Python](https://www.github.com/penrose/penrose-python) for a command line client and Python functions for more advanced operations.

For instructions on how to contribute, and documentation on the endpoints, see
the [RestFUL](https://penrose-lib.github.io/docs/) documentation. You can also
browse [Penrose Library](https://www.github.com/penrose-lib/) packages.
